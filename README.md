# Final Project Mobile Object Oriented Programming

This is a final test from Mobile Object-Oriented Programming Course. This project is a group project. This project asked us to make an application using Java Programming Languages and Android Studio as IDE. My friends and I are thinking of making a calculator app. So, we build an application called “Math The Magic!: Calculator and Quiz” that provides several features such as calculating building formulas, series, and besides that, there is a quiz which of course aims to train users in understanding the use of mathematical formulas. 

By making this application, it is hoped that it can help users in the process of calculating several mathematical formulas and the process of understanding mathematics by doing some quiz questions.

In this project, I have responsibilities as an engineer who builds several functions in the application.
